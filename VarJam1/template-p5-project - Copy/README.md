## Description

Submission for the Variation Jam assignment for Pippin Barr, CART253, fall 2024

This is a project centered around the basic idea of space invaders, except it's your alarms invading your dreams to wake you up (Previous backgammon modification project was started then abandonned because WebGl and 3D were being difficult and I just wasn't feeling great about it.)

Contains base game + 3 variations

Contains self-drawn assets.

Would have benefited from sound and data integration, perhaps with better planning and time management I could have integrated these elements. 

Game 1: Clock Attack 
 - Yeet pillows at your alarms to shut them up before they wake you up!

Game 2: PLEASE!!! MAKE IT STOP!!
 - There's no escape...the noise is all around you, begging you to get out of bed...try your best to defeat the raging alarm clocks.

Game 3: THE PROFESSOR
 - Oh that dreaded 8am class...your professor now haunts your dreams. Escape your professor and silence your alarm clocks to stay at home in bed.

Game 4: THE MOTHER
 - Your mom has arrived to wake you up with her infamous slipper. Dodge her slipper attacks and tire her out so she just gives up and lets you sleep in. Your alarm clocks are definitely still a problem too...
