## Description

This is a single player game in which the player must maneuver the paddle to shoot a soccer ball into the net to win. The speed of the ball is randomized and the mouse controls the paddle used to kick the ball. The player will lose the game if the ball falls below the bounds of the paddle. 

Note to self: I really need to get over my fear of asking for help instead of spending hours trying to figure things out myself...I quickly realized that this was way above my pay grade...oh well...It's done now.
